Pedes!

Hyped as fuck, haven't stopped looking in 14 hours.

I finally located a database that has our video: [https://search.alexanderstreet.com/preview/work/2860692](https://search.alexanderstreet.com/preview/work/2860692)

Here's the catch, only a few universities across the USA have free access to alexander street.

Need you guys to upvote the shit out of this.

Instructions:

Go to your university website. Click on library or databases. See if you have access.

It's part of ProQuest but it's NOT called ProQuest. It's called Alexander Street.

My university only has access to the PBS part of Alexander street.
WE'RE SO FUCKING CLOSE RIGHT NOW GUYS! UPVOTE!!


#Proof it's the right one: 
    Original Release Date
    1998-12-20
